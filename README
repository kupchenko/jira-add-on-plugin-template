This plugin is created to show how to start developing Jira plugin with Spring Scanner.

Atlassian Spring Scanner is a set of libraries that make plugins faster to load and easier to develop.

Here are the SDK commands you'll use immediately:

* atlas-run   -- installs this plugin into the product and starts it on http://localhost:8080/jira
* atlas-debug -- same as atlas-run, but allows a debugger to attach at port 5005
* atlas-cli   -- after atlas-run or atlas-debug, opens a Maven command line window:
                 - 'pi' reinstalls the plugin into the running product instance
* atlas-help  -- prints description for all commands in the SDK
